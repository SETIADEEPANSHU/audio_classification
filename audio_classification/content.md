Problem Statement
=======================

The goal of this project, is to apply Deep Learning techniques to the classification of environmental sounds , specifically focusing on the identification of particular urban sounds.

When given an audio sample in a computer readable format (such as a .wav file) of a few seconds duration, we want to be able to determine if it contains one of the target urban sounds with a corresponding likelihood score.

### Motivation

There is a plethora of real world applications for this research, such as:

Content-based multimedia indexing and retrieval
Assisting deaf individuals in their daily activities
Smart home use cases such as 360-degree safety and security capabilities
Automotive where recognising sounds both inside and outside of the car can improve safety
Industrial uses such as predictive maintenance
Heart, snoring sound classification
