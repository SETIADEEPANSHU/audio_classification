### Overview

Sounds are all around us. Whether directly or indirectly, we are always in contact with audio data. Sounds outline the context of our daily activities, ranging from the conversations we have when interacting with people, the music we listen to, and all the other environmental sounds that we hear on a daily basis such as a car driving past, the patter of rain, or any other kind of background noise. The human brain is continuously processing and understanding this audio data, either consciously or subconsciously, giving us information about the environment around us.

Automatic environmental sound classification is a growing area of research with numerous real world applications. Whilst there is a large body of research in related audio fields such as speech and music, work on the classification of environmental sounds is comparatively scarce. Likewise, observing the recent advancements in the field of image classification where convolutional neural networks are used to to classify images with high accuracy and at scale, it begs the question of the applicability of these techniques in other domains, such as sound classification, where discrete sounds happen over time.

Problem Statement
=======================

The goal of this project, is to apply Deep Learning techniques to the classification of environmental sounds , specifically focusing on the identification of particular urban sounds.

When given an audio sample in a computer readable format (such as a .wav file) of a few seconds duration, we want to be able to determine if it contains one of the target urban sounds with a corresponding likelihood score.

### Motivation

There is a plethora of real world applications for this research, such as:

Content-based multimedia indexing and retrieval
Assisting deaf individuals in their daily activities
Smart home use cases such as 360-degree safety and security capabilities
Automotive where recognising sounds both inside and outside of the car can improve safety
Industrial uses such as predictive maintenance
Heart, snoring sound classification
